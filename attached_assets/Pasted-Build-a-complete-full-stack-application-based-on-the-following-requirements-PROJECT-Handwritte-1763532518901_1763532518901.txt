Build a complete full-stack application based on the following requirements:

📝 PROJECT: Handwritten Form Extraction System (with CRUD API)
🎯 Goal

Create a full-stack web application where users upload handwritten forms (images/PDF), the backend uses Hugging Face Qwen2.5-VL-7B-VL model to extract text, and users can view, edit, update, and delete extracted records.

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS (React + Vite)
Features

Page to upload handwritten form (png, jpg, jpeg, pdf)

Display:

Upload progress bar

Uploaded image preview

Extracted result (table + JSON viewer toggler)

CRUD UI:

List all extracted records

View a single extracted record

Edit/update (inline table editing or separate form)

Delete a record

Buttons:

Download JSON

Download CSV

Use:

React

Axios

TailwindCSS (optional)

JSON viewer component

Frontend API Calls

POST /upload

GET /result/{task_id}

CRUD:

GET /records

GET /records/{id}

PUT /records/{id}

DELETE /records/{id}

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS (Python + FastAPI)
API Endpoints
1. Upload & Extract

POST /upload

Accept file upload

Save file in /uploads

Trigger AI model

Save structured JSON in /results/<task_id>.json

Save data into DB

Return { task_id }

2. Get Result

GET /result/{task_id}

CRUD ENDPOINTS (MUST BE IMPLEMENTED)
3. List all extracted records

GET /records
Return all extracted records from the database.

4. Get single record

GET /records/{id}

5. Update extracted record

PUT /records/{id}
Allow editing field values or labels.

6. Delete a record

DELETE /records/{id}

DATABASE REQUIREMENT

Use SQLite (simple, file-based, ideal for Replit).

Tables

records

id (primary key)

raw_json (TEXT)

created_at

updated_at

AI MODEL REQUIREMENTS
Use Hugging Face Vision-Language Model

Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (or similar)

EXTRACTION PROMPT (USE EXACT TEXT)
You are an AI Agent designed to extract information from handwritten forms.

TASK:
Analyze the uploaded handwritten form image and extract all fields and values accurately.

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON):
{
  "fields": [
    {
       "label": "<Field Label>",
       "value": "<Extracted Handwritten Value>"
    }
  ]
}

RULES:
- Extract all text clearly.
- Keep original meaning.
- If unreadable, set value to "unreadable".
- Do not hallucinate information.
- Return JSON only without explanations.

BACKEND LOGIC

Save uploaded file

Preprocess image

Send to Hugging Face VL model with the prompt

Parse JSON safely

Save JSON to /results/<task_id>.json

Insert record into SQLite

CRUD operations read/write to DB

PROJECT STRUCTURE (Replit must generate)
/frontend
/backend
    /uploads
    /results
    database.db

LIBRARIES TO INSTALL
Backend

fastapi

uvicorn

python-multipart

pillow

transformers

torch

sqlite3 (built-in)

Frontend

react

react-dom

axios

vite

tailwindcss (optional)

FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED

Replit must generate a fully working project:

✔️ Upload + AI Extraction working
✔️ Qwen2.5-VL-7B model integrated
✔️ Clean JSON extraction
✔️ CRUD backend (SQLite)
✔️ CRUD UI on frontend
✔️ Download JSON/CSV
✔️ Beautiful UI
✔️ End-to-end working system
